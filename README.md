Welcome to my game!

## Assignment Objective
The essential goal of this game is simple and straightforward. You are faced against a single Goblin and must win.
You are given three options to use during each 'turn' of combat:
1. Attack
2. Items
3. End
Please just watch the spelling as I didnt find a proper work around to the typing sensitivity yet.
